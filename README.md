This is a simple web application made in Django Framework. This app does not use database postresql, but a similar repo is on my profile with postgresql, feel welcome to check this out, but mind that you have to install postresql and create database.

How to run the following app:
- download/clone repo
- create venv
- install reqs
- python manage.p runserver
