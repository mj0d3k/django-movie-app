This is a simple web application made in Django Framework. This app does not use database, but JSON file that we created.
Sources: wikipedia, wikidata, wikinav.

How to run the following app:
- download/clone repo
- create venv
- install reqs or:
    - pip install scikit-learn selenium numpy django psycopg2-binary
- python manage.py runserver
(remember to run this command inside first catalog 'django-movie' - you need access to manage.py file, otherwhise runserver command will not work)

Check if your fav movie is in our dataset.
